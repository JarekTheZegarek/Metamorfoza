Project created with Embarcadero C++Builder 6.0 (stated at 5.0)
Software enables to read data from EPR measurments. Assemble them, maintain and prepare input data for calculation software. 
It is also posible to calulate so caled shape of the resonance line, this part has been used during students laboratory classes (Institiute of Physics, Technical University of Czestochowa)
Procedure to read old binary form of EPR data files has been adopted also at the EPR program writen at Wroclaw Technical University and distributed with EPR measuring devices they produce.
